# Email Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Enron email dataset to train a model and evaluate its performance. The goal is to implement a basic email classification system that can be further enhanced and refined.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Enron email dataset**, which contains a collection of emails. For this project, we focus on the following fields:
- `message`: The content of the email.
- `label`: A binary classification label indicating whether the email is "spam" or "not spam". (Labels can be generated based on keyword matching or sourced from a labeled dataset.)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model training and evaluation.
  - `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks (optional, depending on enhancements).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (install using pip):
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name


2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook spamemail.ipynb


3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the email classification model is evaluated using:

Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
Confusion Matrix: A table used to evaluate the performance of the classification model.

## Future Improvements
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
Implement advanced text preprocessing techniques (e.g., stemming, lemmatization).
Explore deep learning approaches for better accuracy.
Use a larger dataset with pre-labeled spam and non-spam emails for training.

### Instructions to Use the README

1. **Replace placeholders**: Make sure to replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. **Adjust details**: Feel free to add or modify any sections based on your specific implementation, dataset, or project details.

3. **Create the README file**: Save the above content in a file named `README.md` in the same directory as your Jupyter notebook.

Once you've created the README, it will help others understand your project when they view it on GitHub. If you need further customization or help, just let me know!
